### Troubleshooting steps

This section provides steps intended to assist with troubleshooting common problems with AWS CloudFormation deployments: 

  - In a case of stack creation failures, disabling rollback allows to preview events for each provisioned resource as well as preview cf-init.log; see [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-init.html#cfn-init-Examples) for more details
  - There are several common reasons for deployment failure: 
    * Missing pre-request; see "Prerequisites" section for a particular AWS CloudFomration Template; see [example](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/standalone/1nic/existing-stack/payg/README.md#prerequisites) for more details
    * Missing required parameters; see "Template parameters" section for the complete list of template paramteres required for a particular AWS CloudFormation Template; see [example](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/standalone/1nic/existing-stack/payg/README.md#user-content-installing-the-image-using-the-aws-launch-stack-button) for more details 
    * Missing required resources/infastruture; extistent stack templates require existent infastructure
    * Lack of permissions for IAM user used for CloudFormation deployment
    * Template validation problem; using the [validate-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/validate-template.html) method allows to validate template against AWS
  - AWS Docs provide additional details on possible resolutions of common AWS problems [AWS Docs Troubleshooing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors)
  - In case of recieving deployment failure during BIGIP on-boarding, the BIGIP service logs allow to get insights about the problem: 
    * /var/log/restnoded/restnoded.log - [AS3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/about-as3.html) error log
    * /var/log/restjavad.[0-9].log - restjavad logs; this service provides control-plane access to the BIG-IP using an http REST api.
    * /var/log/cloud/aws/ - this directory includes logs generated by [f5-cloud-libs](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-cloud-libs) tool intended for on-boarding and configuring BIGIP device; the following page [f5-cloud-libs](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-cloud-libs/blob/master/USAGE.md) provides details about each module used by f5-cloud-libs
